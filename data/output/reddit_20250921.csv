1758386499.0,Advancing into Senior Roles,0.79,26,1nm30aq,t3_1nm30aq,"So I've been a ""junior"" Data Engineer for around two years. My boss and I have the typical ""where do you wanna be in the future"" talk every quarter or so, and my goal is to become a senior engineer (definitely not a people manager). But there's this common expectation of leadership. Not so much managing people but leading in solution design, presenting, mentoring junior engineers, etc. But my thing is, I'm not a leader. I'm a nerd that likes to be deep in the weeds. I don't like to create work or mentor, I like to be heads down doing development. I'd rather just be assigned work and do it, not try to come up with new work. Not everyone is meant to be a leader. And I hate this whole leadership theme. Is there a way I can describe this dilemma to my boss without him thinking I'm incapable of advancing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nm30aq/advancing_into_senior_roles/,False,False,False,22,False,LogosAndDust,1970-01-01 00:00:01.758386499

Due to our existing Tech Stack including Boomi iPaaS we have been tasked with taking a look at Rivery to support ingestion into Snowflake (we have a mix of API based feed and legacy SQL server DB data sources).

Initial impressions are okay but wanted to see if anyone here is actually using Rivery and get some feedback  (good or bad) on their experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nmkw5l/anyone_using_rivery/,False,False,False,7,False,br5159,1970-01-01 00:00:01.758436993
1758384671.0,Is DSML course from Scaler worth it?,0.67,1,1nm28h0,t3_1nm28h0,"I'm a non-tech grad with 3 years of experience in IT Support. I would like to pivot to a Gen Al Engineer but I understand that I first need to start with Data Analytics.

I don't think anyone would hire if I just study on my own by following various websites and youtubers. So, I thought of depending on learning platforms for placements. I've looked other alternatives such as Crio, Coding Ninjas, AlmaBetter, Masai, SimpliLearn and GeeksforGeeks but Scaler stands out specifically for Data Sceince although the course has a high fee of 3.5 Lakhs.

Long story short, I want to get into Data within 2 years. So should I join Scaler or not?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nm28h0/is_dsml_course_from_scaler_worth_it/,False,False,False,1,False,Elvenstien,1970-01-01 00:00:01.758384671

1758446467.0,Streaming problem,0.5,0,1nmnexc,t3_1nmnexc,"Hi, I'm a college student and I am ready to do my Final Semester Project. My project is about building a pipeline for stock analytics and prediction. My idea is to stream all data from a Stock API using Kafka as the first step.  
I want to fetch the latest stock prices of about 10 companies at the same time and push them into the producer. 

My question is: is it fast enough to loop through all the companies in the list and push them to the producer? I'm concerned that when looping through the list, some companies might update their prices more than once, and I could miss some data.  
At first, I had the idea of creating a DAG job for each company and letting them run in parallel, but that might not be a good approach since it would increase the load on Airflow and Kafka.

As data engineers:  
\- Do the teams you work in actually care about CSR activities, or is it just management box-ticking?  
\- What’s been the most fulfilling ‘give back’ experience you’ve done as a dev?  
\-  And what activities felt like a total waste of time?
